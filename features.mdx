|---------------|------|------|-------|
| Viewer        | ✅   | ❌   | ❌    |
| Editor        | ✅   | ✅   | ❌    |
| Administrator | ✅   | ✅   | ✅    |

<Expandable title="Advanced Permissions" default-open="false">
  Set custom rules for subfolders using the `{Permissions}` panel. For example, grant edit access only to `Engineering/Team` folders.
</Expandable>

<Callout kind="alert">
  Always review permissions before sharing public links to prevent unauthorized access.
</Callout>

  // Search API example
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/search', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query: 'authentication',
      spaceId: 'your-space-id',
      filters: { type: 'document' }
    })
  });
  const results = await response.json();

      'https://api.example.com/v1/search',
      headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'},
      json={
          'query': 'authentication',
